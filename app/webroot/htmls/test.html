<table width="100%" cellpadding="10"><tr valign="top">
<td width="50%"><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #333; margin: 0px;text-align:left;"><p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another headache? If you suffer from
headaches, you know how painful and frustrating they can be. The most common
causes are tension, migraine, eye strain, dehydration, low blood sugar, and
sinusitis. Before you reach for medicine to cover it up, see if one of these
natural remedies might help you get rid of this headache and the next one
before it starts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drink decaf. If you're a coffee, tea
or soda drinker and you haven’t had any, you might be getting a withdrawal
headache. While getting a caffeinated drink is a quick fix, a healthier choice
is start eliminating caffeine out of your diet altogether.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Drink water.Often
headaches are related to&nbsp;dehydration. Get some water in to your system can get rid of that
headache. Drinking room temperature water is your best bet since water that is
too cold can&nbsp; temporarily give you
even more of a headache (think about what happens when you eat ice cream too
quickly and get brain freeze)!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eat right. If you get headaches
on a regular basis, it could be due to a food allergy or a vitamin that is
missing from your diet. Pay
attention to what you eat and how you feel afterwards so that you can prevent
the headache from happening in the first place. Also, if you get a headache,
determine when you ate last. Sometimes skipping meals can cause headaches so
all you need to do is get some food in your system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fresh air. Breathing deeply can
do wonders for a headache in general; it'll be even more effective as a natural
headache cure if you do it out in the fresh air.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Take a hot shower. Stand in the shower and
allow the hot water to cascade down your neck and back. This should loosen your
muscles and allow for better blood flow. Keep soap, candles or lotions on hand
made with natural oils like sandlewood, peppermint, citrus, eucalyptus,
lavender, all of which have been shown to help alleviate pain. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Relax and rest. This is one of the most
effective and most ignored headache remedies. Sometimes a headache is just your
body telling you that you're overworked. Lie down in a dark room, shut your
eyes, and just relax for awhile. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Ice Pack. You can use an ice pack, a cold towel, a bag of
frozen peas, or anything else that's really cold. Apply this cold item to the
back of your neck (or wherever the pain is located) and allow it to sit for
about 5 to 10 minutes. This technique should help reduce any inflammation, not
to mention help numb the pain a bit. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Cayenne
Pepper Eat
some cayenne or jalapeno pepper to help drain the sinuses, or use a steam
inhalation for the same purpose.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">Supplements Calcium has been reported in at least one study
to decrease PMS symptoms and menstrual headache. If patients take calcium and
magnesium, they should take them at different times of the day, as the calcium
may inhibit the absorption of magnesium. Food sources of calcium include dark
green leafy vegetables, dairy products, seafood, and certain fish. Calcium supplements
should be in the range of 750 to 1,000mg per day. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">Other supplements that
may help include vitamin B2</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging">(riboflavin), vitamin B6
(pyridoxine), calcium, and certain long-chain fatty acids that are contained in
compounds such as fish oil or flaxseed oil. Flaxseed oil at 1,000 mg capsules,
one or two per day is recommended for headache relief.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Natural
Migraine Relief</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric ideograph-other">Feverfew
(Tanacetum parthenium), a member of the sunflower family, has been
used for centuries in European folk medicine as a remedy for headaches,
arthritis, and fevers. The name feverfew comes from a Latin word meaning
&quot;fever reducer.&quot; The dried leaves—and sometimes flowers and stems—of
feverfew are used to make supplements, including capsules, tablets, and liquid
extracts. The leaves are sometimes eaten fresh.</p>
<p class="medicinaparagraphadampragraph">A survey
of 270 people with</p></td>

<td width="50%"><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #333; margin: 0px;text-align:left;">migraines in Great Britain found that more than 70% of them
felt much better after taking an average of 2 - 3 fresh feverfew leaves daily.
Several human studies have used feverfew for migraine prevention and treatment.
Overall, these studies suggest that taking dried leaf capsules of feverfew
daily may reduce the number of migraines in people who have chronic migraines.</p>
<p class="medicinaparagraphadampragraph">One study
used a combination of feverfew and white willow (Salix alba), which
contains aspirin-like chemicals. Participants who took the combination twice a
day for 12 weeks had fewer migraines and they didn' t last as long or hurt as
much. A 3-month study with 49 people found that a combination of feverfew,
magnesium, and vitamin B2 led to a 50% decrease in migraine attacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: hanging; text-autospace: ideograph-numeric ideograph-other">Extra Help</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in">In some cases, you’ll
need extra care to get rid of stubborn headache pain. If you’ve tried
everything above, made lifestyle changes, then it might be time to talk to your
healthcare provider about some other options for headache relief designed to
meet your specific needs. Possible treatments may include chiropractic spinal
adjustments, manual therapy, exercises, neck traction, and/or electrical
stimulation. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: .1in">Winterize Your Immune
System </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
average U.S. adult typically has two to four colds each year, while children
may have up to 12! Colds and the flu account for millions of lost school and
work days, making us desperate to do anything to avoid getting sick. But
sometimes, the cure is worse than the illness. Just last year, with hundreds of
severe reactions, including a death, seasonal flu vaccinations were suspended in
Australia for all children under the age of five. Some research even indicates
that the flu vaccine even increases your likelihood of getting the H1N1 virus.
The flu vaccine isn’t the solution to staying healthy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Viruses
can live on pens, computer keyboards, coffee mugs and other objects for hours,
so most of us come into contact with such viruses daily. But, just because you
encounter such viruses doesn’t mean you will contract the illness. That’s where
your immune system comes into play. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Don’t get stressed out. Stress weakens your
body’s natural immune system and makes you&nbsp;susceptible to the common cold,
the flu and many other germs. </p>
<p>Correct
Vitamin D deficiency. Less than
optimal vitamin D levels will significantly impair your immune response and make
you far more susceptible to contracting colds, influenza, and other respiratory
infections. In a study involving 19,000 Americans, people with the lowest
vitamin D levels reported having significantly
more recent colds or cases of the flu -- and the risk was even greater for
those with chronic respiratory disorders like asthma.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Minimize
Sugar:
Ease up on sodas, pastries and such. Even just a few grams of sugar can destroy
your white blood cells' ability to resist infections for several hours.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white">
Lower your cholesterol. Lowering cholesterol
could help the body's immune system fight viral infections. Researchers at the
University of Edinburgh have shown a direct link between the workings of the immune
system and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Exercise. Aerobic exercise speeds
up the heart to pump larger quantities of blood; makes you breathe faster to
help transfer oxygen from your lungs to your blood; and makes you sweat as your
body heats up. These all help increase the body's natural virus-killing cells.
As Ann G. Kulze, MD, CEO and founder of Dr. Ann and Just Wellness explains,
“Working out regularly enhances immune function.” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Be happy. New research has found
that happiness
may help you fight colds and flu. Researcher Carl Charnetski, MD, professor of
psychology at Wilkes University, found that sex, positive thinking, playing
with a pet, and other pleasurable behaviors&nbsp; boosted participants’ immune systems.. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>If you start getting sick, add use zinc
lozenges which may shorten the duration of common cold episodes by up to 40%,
according to a study published in the Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.
